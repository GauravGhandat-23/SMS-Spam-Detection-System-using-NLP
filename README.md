# SMS-Spam-Detection-System-using-NLP
The SMS Spam Detection System using NLP is a machine learning-based application designed to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). Built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project uses a Naive Bayes classifier to analyze the text of messages and identify whether they are spam or legitimate.
